									<h2><a href="#">Order fulfilment Optimization for Streamline Logistics solutions</a></h2>
									<p>This was a unique data-driven project, aim to enhance operational efficiency and reduce order backlogs in the supply chain and logistics division. 
										Data was segmented by routes, drivers, and allocation rules to uncover performance gaps and inform strategic improvements. 
										An Excel-based interactive dashboard was designed and implemented to track order status, average delivery times, route performance, and driver efficiency in real-time. 
										The analysis led to a 51% backlog reduction initiative and process changes that resulted in a projected 15–20% decrease in delivery delays within one quarter.</p

										<h2><a href="#">CLAIMS PROCESSING TIME REDUCTION AND WORKFLOW AUTOMATION<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="Insurance.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>BrightSecure Insurance Ltd., a leading UK-based insurer, faced growing customer dissatisfaction due to lengthy, manual claims processing taking up to 14 days. This inefficiency led to increased operational costs, compliance risks, and a high volume of support calls. The task was to identify root causes, map the current state, propose an improved future-state process, and recommend automation solutions that reduce claim turnaround time and improve customer satisfaction—while ensuring regulatory compliance. I conducted stakeholder interviews, developed AS-IS and TO-BE process maps, performed 5 Whys and fishbone root cause analysis, and identified key pain points, including manual document verification, lack of system integration, and communication gaps. The proposed solution included the introduction of OCR for document intake, RPA bots for automation, and CRM/API tools for real-time status updates. KPIs were also defined to track success. 
  The initiative projected a 65–70% reduction in claim turnaround time, a 50–70% increase in customer retention, and cost savings of up to £75,000 per year. Staff workload was expected to decrease significantly, with over 70% automation coverage, resulting in higher productivity, an improved customer experience, and stronger compliance assurance.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">CUSTOMER ANALYSIS AND SEGMENTATION USING SQL<br /></a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/image of Customer analytics.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The aim of this project is to segment and target former student account holders who have transitioned into the workforce, enabling NovaTrust Bank to upsell relevant financial products and boost customer lifetime value. 
Using SQL and Power BI, I performed RFM analysis to categorize customers into four value-based tiers and provided tailored recommendations for targeted marketing and product offerings.
This data-driven segmentation enabled the bank to optimize campaign strategies, deepen customer engagement, and uncover upselling opportunities across high-potential segments.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">TeleCare Connect Expansion Project: Enhancing Access to Healthcare<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="Scan 21 Aug 25 · 01·28·44 17557361247351.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>TeleCare Connect, a global telemedicine leader, struggled to reach underserved areas due to poor connectivity, low awareness, and EHR integration issues. The aim is to expand access by improving platform reliability, usability, and compliance while addressing stakeholder pain points.
 I Designed As-Is/To-Be process maps, introduced a Lite Access Layer with low-bandwidth options, automated scheduling, and FHIR-compliant EHR integration. This led to 95% low-bandwidth session success, reduced missed appointments by 50%, improved patient satisfaction (≥4.5/5), and saved clinicians 5 minutes per consultation.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Digital Transformation of Onboarding Process</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/image of Digi Trans of Onboarding2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project is to streamline manual onboarding tasks, automate role-specific training plans, design engaging preboarding modules, standardize onboarding workflows, and implement analytics to measure completion rates. 
									stakeholder interviews was conducted, I mapped current-state boarding workflows, gathered functional requirements, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement automated workflows, a personalized preboarding microsite, and department-specific 30-60-90 day plans. 
This transformation reduced onboarding time by 40%, minimized manual HR coordination, and improved new hire satisfaction and engagement through measurable onboarding analytics and feedback systems.

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/customer feed.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Zara Escapes project involves implementing a feedback management system to collect, analyze, and act on customer feedback, enhancing the overall guest experience. This system aims to improve customer satisfaction, increase loyalty, and drive business growth for Zara Escapes. By leveraging data-driven insights, Zara Escapes can make informed decisions to optimize their services and stay competitive in the market.
